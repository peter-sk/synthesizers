* input_formats for each adapter with ensure format (map format to classes and any(..) them)
* output_format for each pipeline (include "auto" which keeps or uses closest)
* parameter for only ouput or full dict
* save function (via ensure_format and datasetdict.save_...)
* further evaluation metrics for synthcity
* wrapper class for models that makes them saveable to disk/hf hub
* synthpop
* syntheval
* other backends?
